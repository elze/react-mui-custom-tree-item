# An application that uses React MUI (Material UI) to display a customized tree


It is based on create-react-app. 

It uses React MUI (Material UI) library (https://mui.com/) to display a tree view of data. The appearance of the tree nodes is customized in their appearance, and their content is generated programmatically. This was possible thanks to this Stack Overflow article: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69481071/material-ui-how-to-pass-custom-props-to-a-custom-treeitem">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69481071/material-ui-how-to-pass-custom-props-to-a-custom-treeitem</a>.

It is deployed on Vercel here: <a href="https://react-mui-custom-tree-item.vercel.app/">https://react-mui-custom-tree-item.vercel.app/</a>

The data displayed in the tree doesn't make much sense and has little to do with this project; it's borrowed from another, unrelated experiment of mine.
